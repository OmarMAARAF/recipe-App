<h1>Welcome to our React Recipes app!</h1>
<p>This app allows you to discover new recipe ideas by using an external API that provides a database of recipes. You can search for recipes based on various criteria (ingredients, dish type, difficulty, etc.) and view the details of each recipe (ingredients, instructions, prep time, etc.).</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use the app, simply navigate to the search page and enter your desired search criteria. The app will display a list of matching recipes that you can browse through and click on to view the details.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Recipe search: You can use the search form to find recipes based on various criteria.</li>
  <li>Recipe details view: You can view the ingredients, instructions, and other information about each recipe.</li>
  <li>Favoriting recipes: You can save your favorite recipes and view them later from your profile.</li>
  <li>No authentication required: You don't need to create an account or log in to use the app.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the App Locally</h2>
<p>To get started using the app on your own machine, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed on your machine.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by opening a terminal window and running the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/OmarMAARAF/recipe-App.git
</pre>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
npm install
</pre>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
npm start
</pre>
<p>This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. You can now make changes to the code and see the updates live in the browser.</p>
<p>To build the app for production, run the following command:</p>
<pre>
npm run build
</pre>
<p>This will create a production-ready build of the app in the <code>build</code> directory. You can then serve the app using a static file server such as serve or deploy it to a hosting platform like GitHub Pages.</p>
